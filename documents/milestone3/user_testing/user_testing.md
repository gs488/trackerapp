User #2 - Undergrad Ruby
- click on a day on the calendar what would that bring you to? does this bring you to a page view of that particular day? to a screen that looks like the home page?
- what displays when you click on change name?
- question of purpose: is this app basically a planner?
- what happens when onclick repeat? -- are there custom repetitions like on google calendar? for example if I wanted to input an event for every mon & wed, or twice a week, or mon & sunday every week, every other week on mondays etc

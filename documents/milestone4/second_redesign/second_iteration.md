On November 17th, we went through a second redesign in regards to the Record Spending page. As we continued to implement our first redesign, we realized that it was a flaw in our logic to expect a user to input their spending but have it feed directly into Analytics rather than appear in some sort of list first. Hence, we remodeled the user flow to mimic the Task Input user flow. With this redesign, the user is able to view all the spending they input on the Spending screen (now linked in bottom navigation bar instead of the Record Spending page). The spending screen is sectioned by date, similar to the home page. Then, the data is processed and visualized in the Analytics, accessed separately. The main rationale behind adding an extra screen to track spending was to increase transparency for the user.

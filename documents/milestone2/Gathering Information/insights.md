**Gathering Information**

*Method - User Interviews*

We chose to conduct user interviews to better understand the audiences that we are producing an application for. The purpose of these interviews is to identify pain points in users' lives that we can attempt to alleviate through our application. Our methodology includes: writing a script with carefully crafted questions to reduce bias and leading tones; choosing our interviewees based on target audiences; and developing an affinity diagram from user interviews. 

During the interview process, we followed the script word for word to insure consistency and eliminate bias. We also took notes in real-time while speaking with the user to insure that we did not miss important themes or points. Once we received a better picture of who our end users were, we were able to develop user personas to help guide us through the design process. 

Why User Interviews - User Interviews are important because it involves users in the design of a product. It helps designers better address their pain points and to design a product that is attractive to a user.

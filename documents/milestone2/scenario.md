***Audience - People who track their academic goals***

**Scenario 1:**
You are a Cornell Student who has 2 prelims and 3 assignments in the coming week. To get good grades and be academically successful, you try to keep track of your progress. However, often you forget to input some assignments or forget to check your calendar, which is extremely overwhelming. For each class, you want to make sure you know exactly what you have (exams, projects, quizzes, and assignments). You already spend a lot of time on your phone and laptop; thus, you want to input things-to-do and upcoming deadlines on a platform that can be accessed on a mobile device and computer.

**Scenario 2:**
You are a Cornell student with a poor memory who often forgets to to turn in assignments on time. You donâ€™t consider yourself to be organized and this has affected your grades in the past. You want to get better grades in your classes by tracking assignment deadlines. You are visually oriented and are looking for a way to represent what tasks you need to do in order of priority and integrate this to-do list into a calendar. 

***Audience - People who track food spending***

**Scenario 3:** 
You are a Cornell Student who is on a tight budget when it comes down to spending on food. You live in Collegetown so you are not near any dining hall, and thus, you are not on any Cornell meal plan. Your goal is to spend less than $100/week on food. You spend a considerable amount of money on snacks, which prevents you from reaching the goal. Realizing that, you want to track all your food spending differentiating between spendings on groceries and snacks.

**Scenario 4:**
You are a NYC employee who is trying to limit your food spending. Working in NYC requires you to eat out often and food in NYC can be expensive. You want to track your food spending, especially since you purchase food without thinking about how much you spend each week. You want to track your food spending by tracking the amount you spent on each meal. You need  a way to track this information on your phone because you are constantly on your phone for work. 

***Audience - People who track medications***

**Scenario 5:**
You are a female and you have to take your birth control every day for positive sexual health. You have tried using reminder apps with notifications, but even with that you still have missed taking pills at the same time every day. This has led to personal medical scares and anxiety. Thus, you want to track your birth control medication and set a more salient daily reminder to take the medication.

**Scenario 6:**
You are a new graduate who started a new job. You have medication that needs to be taken daily and you need to be reminded of when to take it. Due to your new work life/schedule, your current method of relying on memory is not effective and you often forget to take your medication because you are hardworking. Because of this, you want to track your medication by having a reminder on your phone to take your medication once a day after lunch since your phone is on you at all times. You want to make sure you take the proper dose (don't forget to take and don't take too much).
